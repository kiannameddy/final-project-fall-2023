1. Concept of Site:
    I always liked seeing posts of animals online and I thought it would be cute to make a site 
    just for pets, and thus BarkBook was born. 

2. Meeting Project Requirements:
    a. Signup Page: I made a page where users can enter their information to sign up for an account. 
    b. User Profile Page: I created a user profile page that displays information about the user
        that they entered when creating their user. I also included a place holder image of random dogs 
        to show where I would have intented to put a user profile image. The user is also able to view
        their own posts on their profile page.
    c. Dashboard: I create a feed that displays all posts made by users on BarkBook.
    d. Create a Post: I created a page where users can upload an image and caption to 
        create a post for the account. 
    e. Login Page: Created a stylled sign in page for existing users to seamlessly sign in using
        there email in password
    f. Extras:
        - I added the users username to their posts. 
        - I also added the users posts to their profile page.
